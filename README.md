## Java Loops and Functions

### Exercise 1:
Print 0 through 100 using a while loop.

### Exercise 2:
Print only the even numbers between 0 and 100 using a for loop

### Exercise 3:
Prompt the User for a number.
Create a function in your program that counts from 0 to [NUMBER]

### Exercise 4:
Prompt the User for secret word. Create a while loop that will continually ask the Player to guess the secret word until it’s correct, or 5 wrong guesses have been made. Once it’s correct print ```THAT’S CORRECT!!!``` and also how many guesses it took to get it right. If the Player doesn't get the secret word after 5 tries, end the program and print ```Sorry! Out of guesses :-(``` 

### Exercise 5:
Create a program that sends a different function a number, and that function prints out that many “*”.

### Challenge 1:
Using the '*' function from earlier, produce the output found in the attached image ```exampleoutput.png```:

### Challenge 2:
You open a farm that accepts abandoned rabbits and where you feed and house them. business has been brisk and you have already rescued 30 rabbits. Unfortunately, the rabbit population is growing at an annual rate of 22%, and the max rabbits you can take in is 100.

Write a program that will calculate how long in years before you would exceed the maximum capacity (100) and how big your rabbit population will be. Print out the results:

```The rabbit population will be close to exceeding 100 after ? years.```
```At that time, the rabbit population will be ?```


### Challenge 3:
Use looping to produce the following output

```01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09```

```02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18```

```03 06 09 12 15 18 21 24 27```

```04 08 12 16 20 24 28 32 36```
