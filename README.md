## Java Loops and Functions

### Exercise 1:
Print 0 through 100 using a while loop.

### Exercise 2:
Print only the even numbers between 0 and 100 using a for loop

### Exercise 3:
Prompt the User for a number.
Create a function in your program that counts from 0 to [NUMBER]

### Exercise 4:
Prompt the User for secret word. Create a while loop that will continually ask the Player to guess the secret word until it’s correct, or 5 wrong guesses have been made. Once it’s correct print ```THAT’S CORRECT!!!``` and also how many guesses it took to get it right. If the Player doesn't get the secret word after 5 tries, end the program and print ```Sorry! Out of guesses :-(``` 

### Exercise 5:
Create a program that sends a different function a number, and that function prints out that many “*”.

### Challenge:
Using the '*' function from earlier, produce the output found in the attached image ```exampleoutput.png```:
